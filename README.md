# XLSX to Typst Figure

This is a tool I'm personally using for writing my lab reports. It needs to be cleaned up and is missing some features, but it's working for my basic needs.

## How to use

1. Copy your cells that you want to bring into Typst
2. Execute `python3 main.py`
3. Copy the output
4. Paste into Typst document

## Future features

- Full CLI with options
  - Choose to include column names (useful for formatting)
  - Choose to caption the figure
  - Choose to set alignment
